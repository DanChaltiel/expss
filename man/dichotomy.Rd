\title{Convert variable (possibly multiple choice question) to matrix of dummy variables.}
\usage{
dichotomy(x, keep_unused = FALSE, use_na = TRUE, keep = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector/factor/matrix/data.frame.}

\item{keep_unused}{Logical. Should we create columns for unused value labels/factor levels.}

\item{use_na}{Logical. Should we use NA for rows with all NA or use 0's instead.}

\item{keep}{Numeric/character. Labels/levels/values that should be kept.
By default all values will be kept.}
}
\value{
matrix with 0,1 which column names are value labels. If label doesn't exist for
particular value then this value will be used as column name.
}
\description{
\code{dichotomy} returns matrix with 0,1 and possibly NA.
}
\details{
This function converts variable/multiple response variable(matrix/data.frame)
 with category encoding into matrix with dichotomy encoding (0/1)
suited for most statistical analysis, e. g. clustering, factor analysis,
linear regression and so on.
